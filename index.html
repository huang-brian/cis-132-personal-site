		<p>My name is Brian, and I&rsquo;m taking this class to understand how to design webpages. I currently work in IT for a school district. I hope to transfer to SF State or UCLA and graduate with my Bachelor&rsquo;s in computer science. I have always felt rather comfortable working with technology so I&rsquo;d like to continue working in tech. However, I&rsquo;m not sure if I want to stay in education, move to &quot;Big Tech&quot;, work in finance, entertainment, or psychedelic science and research.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d like to learn how to design my own personal website. In the future, I&rsquo;d like to use the skills from this class to help design and maintain websites for non-profit organizations.</p>

		<h2>Things I do in my free time</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>Attend concerts.</li>
			<li>Browse social media for news, local events, and gossip.</li>
			<li>Go rock climbing.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>I have two favorite websites I&rsquo;d like to share.</p>

		<p>One is <a href="https://thesoundof.love/">thesoundof.love</a>. There&rsquo;s even a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/rabbit-holes/turning-youtube-comments-into-art"><i>New Yorker</i> article</a> written about it!</p>

		<p>The other, although a bit profane, is <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com">motherfuckingwebsite.com</a>. A funny but simple page about web design.</p>
